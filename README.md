# Crop Recommendation Using Machine Learning

Crop recommendation is one of the most important aspects of precision agriculture. Crop recommendations are based on a number of factors. Precision agriculture seeks to define these criteria on a site-by-site basis in order to address crop selection issues. While the "site-specific" methodology has improved performance, there is still a need to monitor the systems' outcomes.Precision agriculture systems aren't all created equal. However, in agriculture, it is critical that the recommendations made are correct and precise, as errors can result in significant material and capital loss.



This application will assist farmers in increasing agricultural productivity, preventing soil degradation in cultivated land, reducing chemical use in crop production, and maximizing water resource efficiency.
